Dart RethinkDB Driver
=========

A [Dart](http://www.dartlang.org) driver for [RethinkDB](http://www.rethinkdb.com) written by Dave Bettin.


Caveat:
=========
This driver is very early in its development.  I'm currently using this driver in a project and will be added funcationality on is as needed basis.


Getting Started:
========

The driver api tries to align with the javascript and python RethinkDB drivers. You can read their documentation [here](http://www.rethinkdb.com/api/).

Until the driver is more complete, your best bet is to look at the drivers' tests to form an understanding of how to use the driver.

Running Tests:
========

Install the latest version of RethinkDB locally and run with the defaults.
_Note: all tests are ran against a live version of the DB._

To execute the drivers' tests, from the root project dir, please run:

```
tools\build.sh
````
